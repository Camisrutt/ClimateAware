# ClimateAware
Building a system that aggreates climate change data and articles to eventually provide easier access to how climate change is effecting us and our environment right now.

Some Plans
-Add markers for every country that help it categorize which region it is from, in preperation for when we make a tab that includes a world map

-Better filters so that it doesnt fetch articles it doesn't need
